This repository is created to contain different WebSocket endpoints used for further testing. E.g. by autobahn 
testsuite.

In order to build the endpoints with the jboss-web.xml explicitly enabling WebSockets (required for JBoss Web => EAP 6.x, AS server with JBossWeb as web container), build the project with -Djbossweb
